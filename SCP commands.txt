
SCP COMMANDS

The basic syntax of the SCP command to perform a file transfer between two remote systems looks as follows:
		
	syntax: scp [other options] [source username@IP]:/[directory and file name] [destination username@IP]:/[destination directory]

Here’s a breakdown of the command:

	[other options]      ‒ modifiers you can add to the SCP command. We’ll cover the most popular ones later.
	[source username@IP] ‒ username and IP of the machine that hosts the target file.
	:/  ‒ informs the SCP command that the user will type in the source directory.
	[directory and file name] ‒ the file’s location and name.
	[destination username@IP] ‒ username and IP of the destination system.
	[destination directory] ‒ the destination directory where the file will be saved.
